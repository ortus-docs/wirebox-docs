# HibernateTransaction

This aspect is a self-binding aspect that will surround methods with native Hibernate transaction blocks.

| ClassMatcher | MethodMatcher               |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| any          | annotatedWith:transactional |

To use, just declare in your binder, overriding the self-binding is totally optional.

```javascript
mapAspect("CFTransaction").to("coldbox.system.aop.aspects.HibernateTransaction");
```
