# Persistence Annotations

The following annotations can be placed in the component declaration to tell the WireBox injector where to persist the constructed object. If no scope annotations are found on the component or mappings then the object is treated as **NO SCOPE** or a prototype/transient object; one that gets constructed and discarded every time.

* `singleton` - A singleton object that persists for the entire life-time of the application
* `scope="registered_scope"` : Persist in a registered scope: session, request, singleton, custom, etc.

```javascript
component singleton{}

component scope="singleton"{}

component scope="request"{}

component singleton threadsafe{}
```
