# Binder Configuration Properties

Whether you use WireBox standalone or within a ColdBox context a Binder gets a structure of configuration properties so it can use them whenever you are configuring it or declaring mappings. If you are in **standalone** mode, the Injector can be constructed with a **properties** structure that will be passed to the binder for usage. If you are in a ColdBox application the ColdBox application configuration structure is passed for you. You can then use these properties with the following methods:

* `getProperty(name,[default])` : Get a specific property
* `getProperties()` : Get all the properties structure
* `propertyExists(name)` : Check if a property exists
* `setProperty(name,value)` : Dynamically add properties to the structure
